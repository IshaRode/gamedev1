    <h2>It is a simple and fun game that involves 2 players at a time. Both players will have 4 different tokens. <br><br>

        Players take turns one by one. When player clicks on roll, any random number from 1 to 6 will appear and the player will move forward. <br><br>
        
        Player must get a 6 to take one character token out. <br><br>
        
        The player who gets the 4 tokens in home first, wins. When the player gets 1 token in home, the score will be updated to +10.
